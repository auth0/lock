For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n\t   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n\t   *\n\t   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n\t   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n\t   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n\t   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n\t   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n\t   *\n\t   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n\t   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n\t   *\n\t   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n\t   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n\t   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n\t   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n\t   *\n\t   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n\t   *\n\t   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n\t   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n\t   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n\t   *\n\t   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n\t   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n\t   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n\t   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n\t   *\n\t   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n\t   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n\t   *     }\n\t   *\n\t   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   */\n\t  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n\t    if (valueA === valueB || valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t      return false;\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' && typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n\t      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n\t      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n\t      if (valueA === valueB || valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB) {\n\t        return true;\n\t      }\n\t      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t        return false;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' && typeof valueB.equals === 'function' && valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    return false;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n\t    if (a === b) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    if (!isIterable(b) || a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size || a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash || isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) || isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) || isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)) {\n\t      return false;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\t\n\t    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n\t      var entries = a.entries();\n\t      return b.every(function (v, k) {\n\t        var entry = entries.next().value;\n\t        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n\t      }) && entries.next().done;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var flipped = false;\n\t\n\t    if (a.size === undefined) {\n\t      if (b.size === undefined) {\n\t        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n\t          a.cacheResult();\n\t        }\n\t      } else {\n\t        flipped = true;\n\t        var _ = a;\n\t        a = b;\n\t        b = _;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var allEqual = true;\n\t    var bSize = b.__iterate(function (v, k) {\n\t      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) : flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n\t        allEqual = false;\n\t        return false;\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\t\n\t  function Repeat(value, times) {\n\t    if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n\t      return new Repeat(value, times);\n\t    }\n\t    this._value = value;\n\t    this.size = times === undefined ?

It can be a\n\t                        function or an array of strings.\n\t\n\t            space       an optional parameter that specifies the indentation\n\t                        of nested structures. If it is omitted, the text will\n\t                        be packed without extra whitespace. If it is a number,\n\t                        it will specify the number of spaces to indent at each\n\t                        level. If it is a string (such as '\\t' or '&nbsp;'),\n\t                        it contains the characters used to indent at each level.\n\t\n\t            This method produces a JSON text from a JavaScript value.\n\t\n\t            When an object value is found, if the object contains a toJSON\n\t            method, its toJSON method will be called and the result will be\n\t            stringified. A toJSON method does not serialize: it returns the\n\t            value represented by the name/value pair that should be serialized,\n\t            or undefined if nothing should be serialized. The toJSON method\n\t            will be passed the key associated with the value, and this will be\n\t            bound to the value\n\t\n\t            For example, this would serialize Dates as ISO strings.\n\t\n\t                Date.prototype.toJSON = function (key) {\n\t                    function f(n) {\n\t                        // Format integers to have at least two digits.\n\t                        return n < 10 ?

It will be passed the\n\t            key and value of each member, with this bound to the containing\n\t            object. The value that is returned from your method will be\n\t            serialized. If your method returns undefined, then the member will\n\t            be excluded from the serialization.\n\t\n\t            If the replacer parameter is an array of strings, then it will be\n\t            used to select the members to be serialized. It filters the results\n\t            such that only members with keys listed in the replacer array are\n\t            stringified.\n\t\n\t            Values that do not have JSON representations, such as undefined or\n\t            functions, will not be serialized. Such values in objects will be\n\t            dropped; in arrays they will be replaced with null. You can use\n\t            a replacer function to replace those with JSON values.\n\t            JSON.stringify(undefined) returns undefined.\n\t\n\t            The optional space parameter produces a stringification of the\n\t            value that is filled with line breaks and indentation to make it\n\t            easier to read.\n\t\n\t            If the space parameter is a non-empty string, then that string will\n\t            be used for indentation. If the space parameter is a number, then\n\t            the indentation will be that many spaces.\n\t\n\t            Example:\n\t\n\t            text = JSON.stringify(['e', {pluribus: 'unum'}]);\n\t            // text is '[\"e\",{\"pluribus\":\"unum\"}]'\n\t\n\t\n\t            text = JSON.stringify(['e', {pluribus: 'unum'}], null, '\\t');\n\t            // text is '[\\n\\t\"e\",\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\t\"pluribus\": \"unum\"\\n\\t}\\n]'\n\t\n\t            text = JSON.stringify([new Date()], function (key, value) {\n\t                return this[key] instanceof Date ?\n\t                    'Date(' + this[key] + ')' : value;\n\t            });\n\t            // text is '[\"Date(---current time---)\"]'\n\t\n\t\n\t        JSON.parse(text, reviver)\n\t            This method parses a JSON text to produce an object or array.\n\t            It can throw a SyntaxError exception.\n\t\n\t            The optional reviver parameter is a function that can filter and\n\t            transform the results. It receives each of the keys and values,\n\t            and its return value is used instead of the original value.\n\t            If it returns what it received, then the structure is not modified.\n\t            If it returns undefined then the member is deleted.\n\t\n\t            Example:\n\t\n\t            // Parse the text.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?

This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks.

It can be a\n                        function or an array of strings.\n\n            space       an optional parameter that specifies the indentation\n                        of nested structures. If it is omitted, the text will\n                        be packed without extra whitespace. If it is a number,\n                        it will specify the number of spaces to indent at each\n                        level. If it is a string (such as '\\t' or '&nbsp;'),\n                        it contains the characters used to indent at each level.\n\n            This method produces a JSON text from a JavaScript value.\n\n            When an object value is found, if the object contains a toJSON\n            method, its toJSON method will be called and the result will be\n            stringified. A toJSON method does not serialize: it returns the\n            value represented by the name/value pair that should be serialized,\n            or undefined if nothing should be serialized. The toJSON method\n            will be passed the key associated with the value, and this will be\n            bound to the value\n\n            For example, this would serialize Dates as ISO strings.\n\n                Date.prototype.toJSON = function (key) {\n                    function f(n) {\n                        // Format integers to have at least two digits.\n                        return n < 10 ? '0' + n : n;\n                    }\n\n                    return this.getUTCFullYear()   + '-' +\n                         f(this.getUTCMonth() + 1) + '-' +\n                         f(this.getUTCDate())      + 'T' +\n                         f(this.getUTCHours())     + ':' +\n                         f(this.getUTCMinutes())   + ':' +\n                         f(this.getUTCSeconds())   + 'Z';\n                };\n\n            You can provide an optional replacer method. It will be passed the\n            key and value of each member, with this bound to the containing\n            object. The value that is returned from your method will be\n            serialized. If your method returns undefined, then the member will\n            be excluded from the serialization.\n\n            If the replacer parameter is an array of strings, then it will be\n            used to select the members to be serialized. It filters the results\n            such that only members with keys listed in the replacer array are\n            stringified.\n\n            Values that do not have JSON representations, such as undefined or\n            functions, will not be serialized. Such values in objects will be\n            dropped; in arrays they will be replaced with null. You can use\n            a replacer function to replace those with JSON values.\n            JSON.stringify(undefined) returns undefined.\n\n            The optional space parameter produces a stringification of the\n            value that is filled with line breaks and indentation to make it\n            easier to read.\n\n            If the space parameter is a non-empty string, then that string will\n            be used for indentation. If the space parameter is a number, then\n            the indentation will be that many spaces.\n\n            Example:\n\n            text = JSON.stringify(['e', {pluribus: 'unum'}]);\n            // text is '[\"e\",{\"pluribus\":\"unum\"}]'\n\n\n            text = JSON.stringify(['e', {pluribus: 'unum'}], null, '\\t');\n            // text is '[\\n\\t\"e\",\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\t\"pluribus\": \"unum\"\\n\\t}\\n]'\n\n            text = JSON.stringify([new Date()], function (key, value) {\n                return this[key] instanceof Date ?\n                    'Date(' + this[key] + ')' : value;\n            });\n            // text is '[\"Date(---current time---)\"]'\n\n\n        JSON.parse(text, reviver)\n            This method parses a JSON text to produce an object or array.\n            It can throw a SyntaxError exception.\n\n            The optional reviver parameter is a function that can filter and\n            transform the results. It receives each of the keys and values,\n            and its return value is used instead of the original value.\n            If it returns what it received, then the structure is not modified.\n            If it returns undefined then the member is deleted.\n\n            Example:\n\n            // Parse the text. Values that look like ISO date strings will\n            // be converted to Date objects.\n\n            myData = JSON.parse(text, function (key, value) {\n                var a;\n                if (typeof value === 'string') {\n                    a =\n/^(\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2})T(\\d{2}):(\\d{2}):(\\d{2}(?:\\.\\d*)?)Z$/.exec(value);\n                    if (a) {\n                        return new Date(Date.UTC(+a[1], +a[2] - 1, +a[3], +a[4],\n                            +a[5], +a[6]));\n                    }\n                }\n                return value;\n            });\n\n            myData = JSON.parse('[\"Date(09/09/2001)\"]', function (key, value) {\n                var d;\n                if (typeof value === 'string' &&\n                        value.slice(0, 5) === 'Date(' &&\n                        value.slice(-1) === ')') {\n                    d = new Date(value.slice(5, -1));\n                    if (d) {\n                        return d;\n                    }\n                }\n                return value;\n            });\n\n\n    This is a reference implementation.
