# Webpack example

This example shows how to bundle the `auth0-lock-passwordless` npm package with [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). It uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to support the new [ES2015 syntax](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/), but it is not a requirement.

First, ensure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. Then, run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies and `npm run build` to build the bundle. Finally, open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
