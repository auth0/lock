[Auth0](https://auth0.com) is an authentication broker that supports social identity providers as well as enterprise identity providers such as Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps, Salesforce.

Lock makes it easy to integrate SSO in your app. You won't have to worry about:

* Having a professional looking login dialog that displays well on any resolution and device.
* Finding the right icons for popular social providers.
* Remembering what was the identity provider the user chose the last time.
* Solving the home realm discovery challenge with enterprise users (i.e.: asking the enterprise user the email, and redirecting to the right enterprise identity provider).
* Implementing a standard sign in protocol (OpenID Connect / OAuth2 Login)

  }
}
```

### webpack

`npm install --save-dev ejs-compiled-loader json-loader transform-loader brfs`

```js
[
  {
    test: /node_modules\/auth0-lock\/.*\.js$/,
    loader: 'transform/cacheable?brfs!transform/cacheable?packageify'

## Demos

The **support/development-demo** directory has a ready-to-go app. In order to run it you need [node](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

Then execute `npm i` to install dependencies (only once) and `npm run demo` from the root of this project.

Finally, point your browser at `http://localhost:3000/` and play around.


## Examples

The **examples** directory has some implementation samples you can find useful:

- [Lock & Webpack sample](https://github.com/auth0/lock/tree/master/examples/webpack)


## Browser Compatibility

We ensure browser compatibility in `Chrome`, `Safari`, `Firefox` and `IE >= 9`. We currently use [zuul](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul) along with [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com) to run integration tests on each push.

## Contributing

To run the tests:

Run `grunt dev` and point your browser to `http://localhost:9999/test_harness.html` to run the test suite.

Run `grunt phantom` if you have PhantomJS installed.

Run `grunt integration` (or `npm test`) if you have [SauceLabs][sauce-url] account. You will need a `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` and `SAUCE_USERNAME` env variables.

To publish a new version use:

```
  # release new version
  $ ./bin/version {patch,minor,major}

  # update remote repository
  $ git push origin master

  # and let Auth0's CI worry about the rest
```
