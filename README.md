## Documentation

## Getting Started

### Browser Compatibility

We ensure browser compatibility in Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE >= 11.

### Installation

Install Lock into your project using [npm](https://npmjs.org):

```sh
npm install auth0-lock
```

From CDN

```html
<!-- Latest patch release (recommended for production) -->
<script src="https://cdn.auth0.com/js/lock/12.0.0/lock.min.js"></script>
```
### Configure Auth0

Create a **Single Page Application** in the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications).

> **If you're using an existing application**, verify that you have configured the following settings in your Single Page Application:
>
> - Click on the "Settings" tab of your application's page.
> - Ensure that "Token Endpoint Authentication Method" under "Application Properties" is set to "None"
> - Scroll down and click on the "Show Advanced Settings" link.
> - Under "Advanced Settings", click on the "OAuth" tab.
> - Ensure that "JsonWebToken Signature Algorithm" is set to `RS256` and that "OIDC Conformant" is enabled.
>   Next, configure the following URLs for your application under the "Application URIs" section of the "Settings" page:

- **Allowed Callback URLs**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Allowed Logout URLs**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Allowed Web Origins**: `http://localhost:3000`

> These URLs should reflect the origins that your application is running on. **Allowed Callback URLs** may also include a path, depending on where you're handling the callback (see below).
> Take note of the **Client ID** and **Domain** values under the "Basic Information" section. You'll need these values in the next step.

### Configure the SDK

Create either an `Auth0Lock` or `Auth0LockPasswordless` instance, depending on your use case:

#### Auth0Lock

```js
import { Auth0Lock } from 'auth0-lock';

const lock = new Auth0Lock('{YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}', '{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}');
```

#### Auth0LockPasswordless

```js
import { Auth0LockPasswordless } from 'auth0-lock';

const lock = new Auth0LockPasswordless('{YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}', '{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}');
```

### Logging In

Configure a listener for the `authenticated` event to retrieve an access token and call `show` to display the Lock widget.

```html
<button id="login">Click to Login</button>
```

```js
lock.on('authenticated', function (authResult) {
  lock.getUserInfo(authResult.accessToken, function (error, profileResult) {
    if (error) {
      // Handle error
      return;
    }

    accessToken = authResult.accessToken;
    profile = profileResult;

    // Update DOM
  });
});

// Show the widget when the login button is clicked
document.getElementById('login').addEventListener('click', () => {
  lock.show()
});.
```
