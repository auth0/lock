[Full Changelog](https://github.com/auth0/lock/compare/v10.23.0...v11.0.0)

Lock v11 is designed for embedded login scenarios and **is not supported in centralized login scenarios** (i.e. Hosted Login Pages). You need to keep using Lock v10 in the Hosted Login Page.

We wrote a [Migration Guide](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock/v11/migration-guide) to make upgrading your app easy. 

**Breaking change**
`lock.getProfile` now expects an access\_token as the first parameter. You'll need to update your code to change the parameter sent (v10 expected an id_token).

**Removed**
The `oidcConformant` flag was used to force Lock v10 to not call legacy endpoints. Lock v11 never uses legacy endpoint so the flag is not needed anymore. If specified, it will be ignored.

**Changed**
Lock v11 default the `scope` parameter to `openid profile email`. This is to make the 'Last Logged in With' window work.

### ** NOTICE ** 
We're trying to figure it out how to help customers that want to upgrade to react@16. The ideal would be to move react and react-dom to peerDependencies, but this would be a breaking change for most of our customers, so we're thinking this through.

In the meantime, react@16 works just fine with this codebase. You'll just have to bundle both versions if you're not using yarn. If you are using yarn, however, you can use the `resolutions` field and pin react@16 to your repo.

- Bump auth0.js version - Fix profile casing (it should not convert to cammelcase) [\#815](https://github.com/auth0/lock/pull/815) ([glena](https://github.com/glena))

In lock v10.9 we introduced an issue in auth0.js that changed the casing of the calls to retrieve the user profile (using `/userinfo` or `/tokeninfo`), everything was converted to camel case. We fixed that issue in this [auth0.js pull request](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js/pull/307) and is part of this release of Lock. If you kept an v10.8 or older no changes are needed, for those who updated to v10.9 you need to revert the changes made to handle the case changes.

**Deprecation notice:**

This version introduces `languageBaseUrl` and `clientBaseUrl` in replacement of `assetsUrl`.

- The application will be fetched from `${clientBaseUrl}/${clientID}.js` and will default to the CDN url including the region (e.g. `https://cdn.eu.auth0.com/client`). The region is inferred from the `domain`.
- The language will be fetched from `${languageBaseUrl}/${lang}.js` and will default to the CDN without the region (e.g. `https://cdn.auth0.com/js/lock/${lockVersion}/`).
- The new options have priority over `assetsUrl`.
- If `assetsUrl` is provided, keep the current behavior: fetch application from `${assetsUrl}/client/${clientID}.js` and languages from `{assetsUrl}/js/lock/${lockVersion}/${language}.js`.
